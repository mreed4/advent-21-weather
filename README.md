Like in all Advent challenges so far, the HTML and CSS here was prebuilt. I converted the page to React.

In addition to React, I implemented (1) an API call to a weather service, and (2) the geolocation API to pull real data. The data is then added to a new object for use in iteration on the front-end. I also converted the SVG code to a React component.
